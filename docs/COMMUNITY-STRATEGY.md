# IdeaRalph Community Strategy
## Building the Strongest Vibe Coder Community on the Internet

*Generated: January 2025*
*Skill Used: Community Building (Spawner)*

---

## 1. THE COMMUNITY "WHY"

### Why Would Someone JOIN?

| Value Proposition | What They Get |
|-------------------|---------------|
| **Brutal Feedback** | Get their ideas roasted by Ralph AND the community |
| **Learn What Works** | See hundreds of ideas scored, learn PMF patterns |
| **Find Co-founders** | Meet other vibe coders building things |
| **Early Access** | First to try new Ralph features |
| **Build in Public** | Accountability partners who actually ship |

**The Hook:**
> "Join the only community where your startup idea gets roasted before you waste 6 months building it."

### Why Would Someone STAY?

| Retention Driver | Implementation |
|------------------|----------------|
| **Daily Entertainment** | Watch other ideas get roasted (addictive) |
| **Progress Tracking** | Share your Ralph Loop iterations, get encouragement |
| **Relationships** | Form bonds with other solo founders |
| **Reputation** | Build status as someone who gives great feedback |
| **Exclusive Value** | Weekly events, early features, founder-only content |

**The Sticky Factor:**
> "I can't miss the daily roasts" + "These are my people"

### Why Would Someone CONTRIBUTE?

| Motivation | Reward |
|------------|--------|
| **Reputation** | "Top Roaster" badge, leaderboard recognition |
| **Reciprocity** | Help others, get help on your ideas |
| **Learning** | Giving feedback sharpens your own PMF instincts |
| **Access** | Champions get direct line to product team |
| **Identity** | "I'm a Ralph community OG" |

## 2. DISCORD STRUCTURE

### Channel Discipline (Avoiding the Graveyard)

**Launch with ONLY these channels:**

```
INFORMATION
|-- #welcome          -> Auto-greeting, rules, how to use Ralph
|-- #announcements    -> Product updates only (locked)
+-- #rules            -> Community guidelines

THE ARENA
|-- #idea-roasts      -> THE MAIN EVENT: Post ideas, get destroyed
|-- #ralph-scores     -> Brag about your scores, share cards
+-- #roast-of-the-day -> Daily featured roast (curated)

BUILDERS
|-- #build-in-public  -> Share what you're shipping
|-- #ship-it          -> Announce launches
+-- #feedback-swap    -> Trade feedback on products

COMMUNITY
|-- #introductions    -> New members introduce themselves
|-- #general          -> Casual chat
+-- #help             -> Ralph questions, community help
```

**That's it. 11 channels. No more until we NEED more.**

### Channel Rules

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **No new channels without 10+ weekly active users** | Dead channels kill vibes |
| **Use threads, not new channels** | Keep activity concentrated |
| **Archive after 2 weeks of inactivity** | No graveyards |
| **Monthly channel audit** | Stay lean |

### The "Where Do I Post?" Cheat Sheet

```
"I have an idea"           -> #idea-roasts
"Look at my Ralph score"   -> #ralph-scores
"I shipped something"      -> #ship-it
"I'm building X"           -> #build-in-public
"How do I use Ralph?"      -> #help
"What's up"                -> #general
```

## 3. LAUNCH & SEEDING STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch Seeding (2 weeks before)

**Find 30-50 Founding Members:**

| Source | Target | Approach |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Twitter mutuals | 15-20 | DM: "Building something for vibe coders, want early access?" |
| Indie Hackers | 5-10 | Engage in threads, invite contributors |
| Existing users | 10-15 | Email: "Join the inner circle" |
| Friends who build | 5-10 | Personal invite |

**Founding Member Criteria:**
- Actually ships things (not just talks)
- Active on Twitter or IH
- Will actually participate (not just lurk)
- Gets the vibe coder culture

**Founding Member Perks:**
- "OG" role forever
- Direct input on community direction
- First to test new features
- Name in credits

### Phase 2: Soft Launch (Week 1)

**Day 1-2: Founding Members Only**
```
- Welcome each founder personally
- Start 3-5 conversations manually
- Ask: "Drop your craziest idea, let's see what Ralph thinks"
- YOU participate heavily (50%+ of messages are from team)
```

**Day 3-5: Content Seeding**
```
- Post 5 example idea roasts
- Create first "Roast of the Day"
- Run first informal AMA
- Get founding members roasting each other's ideas
```

**Day 6-7: Soft Open**
```
- Announce on Twitter (not a big launch, just "we have a Discord")
- Let early followers trickle in
- Continue high-touch engagement
```

### Phase 3: Public Launch (Week 2+)

**Launch Day Checklist:**
- [ ] Product Hunt launch mentions Discord
- [ ] Twitter thread includes Discord link
- [ ] First 100 new members get personal welcome DM
- [ ] "Launch Day Roast Party" event running
- [ ] Team responds to every message within 30 minutes

**First Month Goal:**
> 100 active members (not 100 members, 100 ACTIVE)

**"Roast My Idea" (RMI)**
```

ROAST ME: [Specific feedback request]

Community responds with brutal honesty.
Best roast gets "Top Roaster" role for the day.
```

**"Would You Build This?"**
```
Poll format:
Idea: [Description]
Ralph Score: [X.X]

Reactions:
Fire = Hell yes, I'd build this

## 5. ROLES & GAMIFICATION

### Role Hierarchy

```
TEAM           -> IdeaRalph core team
OG             -> Founding members (permanent)
TOP ROASTER    -> Best feedback this month
CHAMPION       -> Active contributor, mod-lite
SHIPPER        -> Has launched something from Ralph idea
NEW BUILDER    -> Just joined
```

### Earning Roles

| Role | How to Earn |
|------|-------------|
| **Top Roaster** | Most helpful feedback votes in a month |
| **Champion** | Nominated by team, consistent quality contribution |
| **Shipper** | Post proof of launch in #ship-it |

### Gamification That Works

**DO:**
- Recognition for helping others (not just posting)
- Exclusive access for top contributors
- Real rewards (swag, features, shoutouts)
- Status that means something

**DON'T:**
- Points for just showing up
- Leaderboards that encourage spam
- Rewards without meaning

### The "Ralph Points" System (Optional, Phase 2)

```
Earn points:
+5  = Post an idea for roasting
+10 = Give quality feedback (upvoted by OP)
+20 = Your roast is "Roast of the Day"
+50 = Ship something from a Ralph-validated idea

Spend points:
100 = Priority in Live Roast sessions
250 = 1-on-1 with team member
500 = Feature naming rights
1000 = "Ralph Legend" permanent role
```

## 7. AVOIDING THE SHARP EDGES

### Sharp Edge #1: Ghost Town Discord
**Risk:** Create 20 channels, nobody uses them

**Prevention:**
- Launch with 11 channels only
- Monthly audit: <5 messages/week = archive
- Use threads instead of new channels
- Activity must justify existence

### Sharp Edge #2: Platform Lock-In
**Risk:** Discord bans us, community gone

**Prevention:**
- **Email capture:** Every member prompted to join newsletter
- **Content mirroring:** Best discussions archived on blog
- **Backup comms:** Twitter as secondary, email as tertiary
- **Regular exports:** Document key discussions externally

### Sharp Edge #3: Founding Member Departure
**Risk:** Core members leave, energy dies

**Prevention:**
- Cultivate "next 10" from month 3
- Rotating event hosts (not just founders)
- Document culture in playbook
- Graceful transitions with alumni roles

### Sharp Edge #4: Moderation Burnout
**Risk:** Volunteer mods burn out, chaos ensues

**Prevention:**
- Minimum 3 mods at all times
- Monthly mod check-ins: "How are YOU doing?"
- Clear escalation path to team
- Permission to take breaks
- Consider paid community manager at 500+ active

### Sharp Edge #5: Support Flooding
**Risk:** Community becomes unpaid support team

**Prevention:**
- Clear separation: #help (community) vs support (email)
- Redirect product issues to proper channels
- Pin: "For bugs, email support@. For community help, post here."
- Don't let bug reports die in Discord threads

## THE RALPH COMMUNITY MANIFESTO

```
We are vibe coders.

We ship fast and break things.
We'd rather be roasted than be delusional.
We help each other build, not tear each other down.
We celebrate ships, not ideas.
We value brutal honesty over polite lies.

If your idea sucks, we'll tell you.
Then we'll help you make it better.

That's the Ralph way.
```
