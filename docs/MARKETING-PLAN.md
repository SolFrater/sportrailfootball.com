## Assembled by the Strategist Team

*Generated: January 2025*
*Skills Used: Growth Strategy, Community Building, Content Strategy, YC Playbook*

## 1. BRAND POSITIONING

### The Category
**IdeaRalph is NOT:** A chatbot, an AI wrapper, another ideation tool

**IdeaRalph IS:** The AI co-founder that validates your startup ideas with brutal honesty before you waste months building the wrong thing

### Positioning Statement
> For **vibe coders and solo founders** who need to validate startup ideas fast, **IdeaRalph** is the **AI co-founder that scores and refines ideas** that, unlike brainstorming with ChatGPT, **gives you a PMF score, brutal feedback, and iterates until your idea is actually fundable**.

### The "Ralph Factor"
What makes Ralph different:
- **Personality**: Ralph has opinions. He's not a yes-man. He'll tell you your idea sucks.
- **Loop**: The Ralph Loop iterates until score hits 9.5+ - not one-shot feedback
- **PMF-First**: 10-dimension scoring based on actual PMF criteria
- **Action-Oriented**: Generates PRDs and architecture, not just vibes

## 2. GROWTH LOOP

### Primary Loop: Idea -> Share -> Validate -> Build

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    THE RALPH LOOP                           |
|                                                             |
|  User has idea -> Ralph scores it -> User shares score ->   |
|  Friends see -> Friends try Ralph -> New ideas generated -> |
|  Loop repeats                                               |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Viral Mechanics

| Mechanic | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Shareable Output** | PMF score cards with Ralph commentary (like Spotify Wrapped) |
| **Social Proof** | "My idea scored 8.7! Ralph says..." -> Twitter/X bait |
| **Competition** | "Can you beat a 9.5?" challenges |
| **Build in Public** | Ralph Loop iterations as content |

### Magic Moment
> **When user sees their first PMF score and Ralph's brutally honest feedback.**

Time to magic moment: **< 60 seconds**

**Optimize for:**
- No signup required for first validation
- Instant score display
- Shareable card generated automatically

## 3. ACQUISITION CHANNELS

## 6. METRICS THAT MATTER

### North Star Metric
> **Ideas Validated Per Week**

### Tracking Hierarchy

| Level | Metric | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|

| **Retention** | Return users (7-day) | 40%+ |

## 8. THE RALPH VOICE

### How Ralph Talks

**DO:**
- Brutally honest but helpful
- Uses data and frameworks
- Has strong opinions
- Celebrates good ideas genuinely

**DON'T:**
- Mean for the sake of mean
- Generic AI speak
- Wishy-washy "it depends"
- Overly formal

### Example Ralph Commentary

**Bad idea (score 4.2):**
> "Look, I appreciate the ambition, but 'Uber for laundry' in 2025 is a tarpit. The unit economics don't work unless you're doing 10K loads/day. Your defensibility score is a 2 because DoorDash could add this tomorrow. Let me show you what could make this a 7+..."

**Good idea (score 8.9):**
> "Now THIS is what I'm talking about. Problem clarity is off the charts - every vibe coder has felt this pain. Timing is perfect with the AI coding wave. Only thing keeping you from 9.5 is the monetization model - let's iterate on that..."
